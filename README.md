### ðŸ”° Proposal Details

**Proposed Title :**  Improvement of Optical Confinement for the Perovskite Solar Cell <br> <br>
**Perovskite Cell Structure :** <br> ![Perovskite Cell Structure](https://github.com/Iftu119/ug-Thesis/blob/main/Perovskite%20Solar%20Cell%20Structure.png)
**Working Procedure Brief :** There are numerous software available for solar cell simulation and performance analysis related works i.e. Silvaco, Scaps 1D, WxAMPS, Ansys Lumerical, Comsol Multiphysics, SunShine etc. Looking at the scale and scope of the work, we plan to execute the simulations on Lumerical. Considering the timeline and scope of this work, initially we plan to individually simulate the following techniques. 
- [ ] Anti-reflection coating layer
- [ ] Spheroid Ag nanoparticle at the back
- [ ] Atop antireflection electrode based on dielectric fiber arrays <br>

We will be analyzing the performance indicating parameters and optimize them accordingly. <br> <br>
